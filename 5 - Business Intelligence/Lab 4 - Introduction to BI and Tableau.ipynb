You will notice that the quarters are currently named labeled 0, 4, 8, 12. [Rename](https://onlinehelp.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/datafields_fieldproperties_aliases_ex1editing.htm) them more intuitively by right-clicking on the Quarter dimension, selecting Aliases and changing their names to Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 respectively.\n",
